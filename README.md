#Qwizzle Frontend Task#

This is a short exercise given to all candidates who will be working on the front-end portion of the Qwizzle app. The task is purposefully simple; our aim
is to make sure that you can write CSS in a clean manner, and that you are clear and consistent with your work.

##The task##

There are two PNG files in this folder. outcome-desktop.png and outcome-mobile.png. The task is to create a responsive page based on those designs.

What we're looking for is the following:

- You can write clean and modular CSS.
- You understand how to make a website responsive.

##The variables##

- title font: museo-sans-round
- title font size: 40px
- title colour: #5b4dc8

- subtitle font: museo-sans-round
- subtitle font size: 26px
- subtitle colour: #5b4dc8

- body font: proxima-nova-soft
- body font size: 16px

- icon width: 122px

For this exercise, it's not important for you to achieve pixel perfection. You can decide on your own values for the grid width and spacing.
